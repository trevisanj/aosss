Introduction
============

Project AOSSS (Adaptive Optics Systems Simulation Support) provides a set of tools to
assemble cubes of spectra to input into the `WebSim-COMPASS <http://websim-compass.obspm.fr/>`_
telescope and spectrograph simulator, and also to download, visualize and organize the output data
files
generated by this simulator.

Project AOSSS installs as a Python package named ``aosss``. This package includes an API (application
programming interface) and a set of :doc:`scripts`.

Script ``cubeed.py`` was created to assemble a data cube to be used as a "template" for the
simulator.

Scripts ``get-compass.py``, ``create-spectrum-lists.py``, ``create-simulation-reports.py``, and
``organize-directory.py`` are tools to go through the bulk of files generated by the simulation
session and can batch-treat multiple sessions in useful ways.

Script ``wavelength-chart.py`` provides a handy way to visualize the wavelength coverages of the
different operational modes of a particular spectrograph, allowing to see where particular spectral
lines of interest will sit within (or without) there  modes as given redshifts..

Finally, ``splisted.py`` can edit groups of simulated spectra to raise statistics or convert these
spectra to CSV format to be exploited elsewhere.
