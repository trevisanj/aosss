Introduction
============

Project AOSSS was started to support telescope+spectrograph simulations carried out at the
`WebSim-COMPASS <http://websim-compass.obspm.fr/>`_ plaftorm.

It provides tools to:

    - create input data cubes for that plataform
    - download, visualize, generate reports, and organize results from the simulator

In addition, there is a tool to plot spectral lines of interest *versus* spectrograph modes coverage
at given redshifts.

The package also contains a library (API - application programming interface) to deal with photometric problems
and to calculate the color of a spectrum. This API is used in the project applications, but may be used
more broadly.
